Quantum variables and operations lie at the heart of the Qmod language but they are not enough for designing all quantum algorithms. To complete the picture, you may need to perform classical control flow with classical operations over classical variables. Typical Python operations include `for` loops and `if-else` statements over `int` or `float` variables.

In Qmod, equivalent types for the common Python `int`, `float`, and `bool` types are denoted by `int`, `real`, and `bool` in the native syntax and by `CInt`, `CReal`, and `CBool` in the Python SDK. In addition, arrays of classical values are also supported as well as more configurable data structures called `Struct`s (which are the equivalent of Python dataclasses without methods). See the full list of [classical variables and types supported in Qmod](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/qmod-reference/language-reference/classical-types/#structs). 

For now, the only two classical operations supported in Qmod are `repeat` (which is the equivalent of a Python `for` loop) and `if-else` statements. See a [detailed description](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/qmod-reference/language-reference/statements/classical-control-flow/).

Examine how to manage classical control flow in Qmod via this example.

## Concrete Example

The task is to create a quantum array with $10$ qubits in the state of $|1010101010\rangle$; i.e., a quantum state with alternating qubit states of zeros and ones. 

How to do this? Knowing that a general qubit array can be easily initialized to the state of all zeros; i.e., $|0000000000\rangle$, you need to flip the state of every second qubit or all the qubits in an even position (the qubits in the $0th$ position, $2nd$ position, $4th$ position, etc.).

Approach this task in two steps. First, create a `apply_condition` function that receives a qubit and its position within the qubit array. If the position is even then it flips its state. Secondly, go over all the qubits in the qubit array and apply the function on each qubit.

The `apply_condition` function receives a qubit variable named `qubit` and a classical integer variable `index`. If the `index` variable is an even number, apply an `X` gate on the `qubit`, which flips its state.


=== "Python"
    ```python
    from classiq import *
    
    
    @qfunc
    def apply_condition(index: CInt, qubit: QBit):
        if_(condition=index % 2 == 0, then=lambda: X(qubit))
    ```

=== "Native"
    ```
    qfunc apply_condition(index: int, qubit: qbit) {
      if ((index % 2) == 0) {
        X(qubit);
      }
    }
    ```

The condition of whether the `index` variable is even evaluated is using the `%` modulo operation, which calculates the reminder of the `index` integer divided by $2$. Note that the Python SDK uses the `lambda:` construct before the `X(qubit)` operation. As described in the [Quantum Variables and Functions Tutorial](./quantum_variables_and_functions.ipynb), in the Python SDK every function that is given as an argument for another function needs to have the `lambda:` prefix.

The argument of the `main` function is a qubit array named `x`. Initalize it to the state $|0000000000\rangle$ with $10$ qubits using the `allocate` function. Then apply the `repeat` classical operator, applying the `apply_condition` function $10$ times, once per qubit in the `x` qubit array.


=== "Python"
    ```python
    @qfunc
    def main(x: Output[QArray]):
        allocate(10, x)
        repeat(count=x.len, iteration=lambda index: apply_condition(index, x[index]))
    ```

=== "Native"
    ```
    qfunc main(output x: qbit[]) {
      allocate(10, x);
      repeat (index: x.len) {
        apply_condition(index, x[index]);
      }
    }
    ```

The `repeat` operator has two arguments. First, specify the number of repetitions. In this case, set it to the length of the `x` qubit array. Second, specify the repeated statement (or statements), using the `apply_condition` function with the `index` and corresponding qubit `x[index]` arguments. Take note of the differences in syntax between the native and Python SDK versions when declaring the counting index with the `index` variable.

That's it, the algorithm is ready for you to synthesize and view:


```python
quantum_program = synthesize(create_model(main))
show(quantum_program)
```


<div  style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="https://docs.classiq.io/resources/classical_operations.gif
">
</div>

Evaluate the results by executing the quantum program on the default simulator:


```python
results = execute(quantum_program).result()[0].value
print(results.counts)
```


<div  style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="https://docs.classiq.io/resources/classical_operations_execute.gif
">
</div>

The only measured bit string is $0101010101$, which in Classiq notation is read from right to left when interpreted. Hence, it corresponds to the $|1010101010\rangle$ state, which is exactly what you tried to achieve!

## Summary - Classical Variables and Operations

A summary of the main points:

* Qmod supports the use of classical variables. The example above explicitly declares and uses the `index` integer variable. The length of the `x` qubit array is also a classical integer variable that is used implicitly in the `repeat` operation.

* Qmod supports the use of classical operations that receive classical variables and quantum operations that are applied according to the classical operation logic. In the example, the `if` classical operation applies the quantum operation `X(qubit)` if the classical variable `index` is even, and the classical operation `repeat` applies the quantum operation `apply_condition` 10 times as the result of evaluating `x.len`.
