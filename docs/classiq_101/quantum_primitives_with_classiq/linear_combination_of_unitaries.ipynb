Quantum computing is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, which includes an important feature: unitarity. The operations that evolve quantum states on quantum computers are unitary.  Would this mean that problems requiring non-unitary operations are out of hand for quantum computers? This is the task solved by the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) algorithm [[1](#childs_paper), [2](#childs_notes)]. 

Given a non-unitary matrix $A$ that can be decomposed into a sum of unitary matrices as follows:

\begin{equation}
    A = \sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} \alpha_i U_i,
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_i$ are real, positive coefficients and $U_i$ are unitary matrices, the LCU algorithm applies the action of $A$, up to a normalization factor, on a desired quantum state. 

It does so by embedding the matrix $A$ in a bigger unitary. The first step of the LCU is to prepare the following state on an auxiliary quantum register according to the coefficients $\alpha_i$ using the function PREPARE:

\begin{equation}
    |\psi_0\rangle = PREPARE|0\rangle = \sum_i \sqrt{\frac{\alpha_i}{\lambda}}|i\rangle,
\end{equation}

where $\lambda = \sum_i |\alpha_i|$ is a normalization factor. This quantum register with the prepared state is used as a controller for the next step. Then, according to the controller quantum register, the following state is being prepared:

\begin{equation}
    SELECT|i\rangle|\psi\rangle = |i\rangle U_i |\psi\rangle,
\end{equation}

where $|\psi\rangle$ is the desired quantum state the matrix $A$ should be applied on. The final step is to have the PREPARE operation inversed such that the following desired state is created: 

\begin{equation}
    LCU|0\rangle|\psi\rangle = PREPARE^{-1}\, SELECT\, PREPARE |0\rangle|\psi\rangle = V |0\rangle |\psi\rangle,
\end{equation}

where $V$ can be represented as



$$V = \begin{bmatrix}A & \cdot \\ \cdot & \cdot \end{bmatrix}.$$



This is called the Block Encoding of the matrix A. By projecting the controller quantum register on the $|0\rangle$ state the desired outcome is obtained:

\begin{equation}
    \left(|0\rangle\langle0|\otimes I\right)LCU|0\rangle|\phi\rangle = |0\rangle\frac{A}{\lambda}|\psi\rangle.
\end{equation}

Therefore, the action of the sequence of operations over the target qubit will be the non-unitary operation $A$, up to a normalization factor. 

Detailed mathematical description of the algorithm can be seen [below](#mathematical-description) and in refernce [[1](#childs_paper)]. It is also important to notice that the projection onto the $|0\rangle$ state depends on a success probability, detailed in [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5822).

Overall, a scheme of the algorithm looks like:

## Guided Implementation

Now that we know how the LCU algorithm works, it's time to implement it on Classiq. For that, we will be using two important functions:
* [Within-Apply](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/qmod-reference/language-reference/statements/within-apply/ )
* [Prepare state](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/qmod-reference/library-reference/core-library-functions/prepare_state_and_amplitudes/prepare_state_and_amplitudes/)



<details>
<summary>How does the Within-Apply function work?</summary>

The Within-Apply maps unitary operations of the kind $V = U^{-1} W U$ into the quantum circuit, given $U$ and $W$. 

For example, if the W operator is the mcx gate and U is the Quantum Fourier Transform, the Within-Apply function would look like this on [Classiq's IDE](https://platform.classiq.io/):

![Within_Apply_Gif](https://docs.classiq.io/resources/Within_apply_gif.gif)

</details>

The Prepare state function realizes the initial state preparation step of a quantum algorithm, given a bound for the error and the probabilities of the quantum states. Using [this tutorial](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/qmod-reference/library-reference/core-library-functions/prepare_state_and_amplitudes/prepare_state_and_amplitudes/), one can play with this function.

The objective of our quantum circuit is to define the matrices $U$ and $W$ following the $V = U^{-1} W U$ decomposition used in the Within-Apply function. A quick look on the definition of the LCU operator is enough to identify $U = PREPARE$ and $W = SELECT$. As an example, we will be considering the following SELECT operator:

\begin{equation}
    SELECT = |0\rangle\langle 0|\otimes I + |1\rangle\langle 1|\otimes QFT +   |2\rangle\langle 2| \otimes QFT^{-1},
\end{equation}

where QFT is the Quantum Fourier Transform operator that acts over the two target qubits, and that the probabilities are $\alpha = [0.5,0.25,0.25,0]$.

Now that the operations are identified, we just need to build them and then use the Within-Apply function. The SELECT operation can be build using the [control](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/qmod-reference/language-reference/statements/control/) statement, and the [QFT function](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/explore/functions/qmod_library_reference/classiq_open_library/qft/qft/):


=== "Python"
    ```python
    from classiq import *
    
    
    @qfunc
    def lcu_controllers(controller: QNum, psi: QNum):
        control(ctrl=controller == 0, stmt_block=lambda: apply_to_all(IDENTITY, psi))
    
        control(ctrl=controller == 1, stmt_block=lambda: qft(psi))
    
        control(ctrl=controller == 2, stmt_block=lambda: invert(lambda: qft(psi)))
    ```

=== "Native"
    ```
    qfunc lcu_controllers(controller: qnum, psi: qnum) {
      control (controller == 0) {
        apply_to_all(IDENTITY, psi);
      }
      control (controller == 1) {
        qft(psi);
      }
      control (controller == 2) {
        invert {
          qft(psi);
        }
      }
    }
    ```

Using two auxiliary qubits, this sequence of operations can be seen in Classiq's IDE as

![LCU_controllers_gif](https://docs.classiq.io/resources/LCU_Controllers_gif.gif)

With the SELECT function defined, we are able to apply the V operator, by using the Within-Apply function. For this, it is necessary to build the PREPARE operator, which will be done using the inplace_prepare_state() function, that requires the probability distribution $\alpha$, the maximum error in the decomposition of the operator and the target qubits, which are the controllers. Thus, the sequence of operations we will define in our quantum program is:
* Define the error bound in the decomposition, and define the probability distribution $\alpha$
* Allocate target and control qubits
* Execute the Within-Apply function, using the PREPARE and SELECT functions


=== "Python"
    ```python
    @qfunc
    def main(controller: Output[QNum], psi: Output[QNum]):
    
        # Defining the error bound and probability distribution
        error_bound = 0.01
        controller_probabilities = [0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0]
    
        # Allocating the target and control qubits, respectively
        allocate(2, psi)
        allocate(2, controller)
    
        # Executing the Within-Apply function, the SELECT function is defined by lcu_controllers and the PREPARE function is defined by the inplace_prepare_state function.
        within_apply(
            within=lambda: inplace_prepare_state(
                probabilities=controller_probabilities, bound=error_bound, target=controller
            ),
            apply=lambda: lcu_controllers(controller, psi),
        )
    
    
    quantum_model = create_model(main)
    quantum_program = synthesize(quantum_model)
    ```

=== "Native"
    ```
    qfunc main(output controller: qnum, output psi: qnum) {
      allocate(2, psi);
      allocate(2, controller);
      within {
        inplace_prepare_state([0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0], 0.01, controller);
      } apply {
        lcu_controllers(controller, psi);
      }
    }
    ```

Your quantum program is done! You can see it using Classiq's IDE with the show() command:


```python
show(quantum_program)
```


In the IDE, this quantum algorithm would look like this:

## Mathematical Description

The initial state of our circuit is $|0\rangle|\Psi\rangle$, for some general $\Psi$. After that, the PREPARE operation is applied, transforming it in the state:

\begin{equation}
    PREPARE|0\rangle|\Psi\rangle = \left(\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} \sqrt{\frac{|\alpha_i|}{\lambda}} |i\rangle\right)|\Psi\rangle.
\end{equation}


We can always represent the PREPARE operation, which acts only in the control qubits, as being:

\begin{equation}
    PREPARE = \sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} \sqrt{\frac{|\alpha_i|}{\lambda}} |i\rangle\langle 0| + \sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1}\sum_{j=1}^{2^n-1} \beta_{i,j} |i\rangle\langle j|,
\end{equation}

for some $\beta_{i,j}$. The SELECT operation, which acts both in the control and target qubits, can also be described this way by

\begin{equation}
    SELECT = \sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} |i\rangle\langle i|\otimes U_i.
\end{equation}

Now, the state generated by $PREPARE^{-1}\, SELECT\, PREPARE |0\rangle|\psi\rangle$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
    PREPARE^{-1}\, SELECT\, PREPARE |0\rangle|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\lambda}|0\rangle\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} \alpha_i \, U_i |\Psi\rangle + \sum_{j=1}^{2^n-1} \left( \sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} \beta_{i,j}^*\right) |j\rangle\,U_j |\Psi\rangle
\end{equation}

When applying the projector $|0\rangle\langle 0|$ onto the control qubits, we finally obtain the desired state

\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{\lambda}|0\rangle\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} \alpha_i \, U_i |\Psi\rangle = |0\rangle\frac{A}{\lambda}|\Psi\rangle.
\end{equation}
