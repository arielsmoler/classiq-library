Final Working Version Output:
Quantum program link: https://platform.classiq.io/circuit/30XrNkgZxgp9GvGwI1y1AgcXneK
Circuit width (number of qubits): 22
Quantum program link: Not available

Depth/Width Tradeoff Analysis:
- Optimizing for depth typically results in using more qubits (ancillas)
- This allows parallel execution of operations that would otherwise be sequential
- The tradeoff is increased qubit requirements vs reduced circuit depth
- This circuit uses 22 qubits to implement the arithmetic operations
- The depth optimization allows arithmetic operations to be parallelized

Successfully demonstrated synthesis optimization for circuit depth!
The program computes y = xÂ² + 1 where x is a 3-qubit quantum number in superposition.
