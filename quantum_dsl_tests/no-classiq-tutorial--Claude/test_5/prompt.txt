Test 5: Within-Apply Pattern (Intermediate)
Implement a Classiq program using within-apply to compute res = x + y + z where:
1. Initialize x=3, y=5, z=2
2. Use within_apply to:
  - First add x and y into a temporary variable
  - Then add the temporary result to z to get final result
  - Automatically uncompute the temporary variable
3. Synthesize and execute
