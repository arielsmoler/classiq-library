Test 2: Bell State Creation (Basic)
Create a quantum program in Classiq that:
1. Declares a QArray of 2 qubits as output
2. Applies Hadamard gate to the first qubit
3. Applies CX gate with first qubit as control and second as target
4. This should create the |+⟩ Bell state: (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2
5. Synthesize and execute to verify only |00⟩ and |11⟩ states appear
