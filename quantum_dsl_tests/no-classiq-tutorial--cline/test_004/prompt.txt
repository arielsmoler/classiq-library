Test 4: Superposition Arithmetic (Basic)
Create a Classiq program that:
1. Declares 'x' as a 2-qubit quantum number
2. Declares 'y' as a 3-qubit quantum number
3. Uses prepare_state to initialize x to equal superposition of 0 and 2
4. Uses prepare_state to initialize y to equal superposition of 1, 2, 3, and 6
5. Computes res = x + y
6. Synthesize and execute
