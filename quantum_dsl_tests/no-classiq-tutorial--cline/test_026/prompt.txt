Test 26: qstruct
Write a quantum program in Classiq that defines the following logic:
1. define a function foo that expects a Qstruct named QVars with 2 qnums x and y, each of size 3.
2. in the function foo body it applies phase based on the sum of the 2 qnums.
3. the main function initializes the qstruct, then applies hadamard transform on the qstruct before and after a call to foo.
4. Synthesize the main function, execute the quantum program, and print the the most probable result.
