Test 27: grover_search

Write a quantum function in Classiq that defines the following logic:
1. Create a predicate function that evaluates the expression ((a + b) + (c & 6)) % 4) | (4 & c)) == 4 for quantum numbers a (2 qubits), b (2 qubits), and c (3 qubits)
2. Implement Grover's search algorithm with 3 iterations to find values that satisfy this predicate
3. Use a phase oracle within the search
